    <h2>A light and quick version of the well known shrimp scampi</h2>
    <p>Shrimp scampi is a classic, known for the high carb past and the buttery topping.
        This meal provides a solution to all of the issues you've ever had with shrimp scampi. 
        It is lower carb and much quicker to make while maintaining the usual taste. 
        Oh and I'm sure you've heard of cherries on top, but we like to say shrimp on top because 
        it is the perfect way to cap this dish.</p>
